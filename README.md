# Webdropper

Use case: People in our hackerspace need to transfer files to the lasercutter
computer.

Solution: They go to `http://lasercutter/` where a webdropper instance is
hosted. Then they can drag & drop a file to the website, and it automagically
lands in the appropriate directory on the lasercutter PC.
